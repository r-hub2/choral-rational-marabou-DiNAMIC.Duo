# DiNAMIC.Duo 1.0.3

* DiNAMIC.Duo 1.0.3 submitted to CRAN on April 4, 2025

## Bug fixes

* The dataPrep() function was updated in order to fail gracefully if an
Ensembl Archive is not available.

# DiNAMIC.Duo 1.0.2

* DiNAMIC.Duo 1.0.2 submitted to CRAN on March 10, 2023

## Minor changes

* The DESCRIPTION file was updated to include SystemRequirements that were not 
required in earlier versions of the package.  Also, the citation for the DiNAMIC.Duo
manuscript was added.

* The onAttach() function was removed.  Previously, there was an interactive session
at start-up during which users were asked whether Miniconda was installed.  If not, they 
were prompted to install it.  This has been deprecated.  Now the "Python and NumPy" subsection
of the vignette tells users how to use the reticulate R package to install Miniconda and
NumPy.

* The vignette was updated and now includes R code to install Miniconda and NumPy using
the reticulate R package.

## Bug fixes

* The documentation for the included data (luadSubset, luscSubset, and pD) was modified to address
NOTEs generated by CRAN that were not present at the time of the initial submission.
