# DiNAMICDuo

DNA copy number changes (gains and losses) are commonly seen in tumor tissue.  Some copy
number changes provide a selective growth advantage, and these are observed in the same
genomic region across multiple samples.  These copy number changes are termed recurrent.
In contrast, sporadic copy number changes that occur randomly throughout the genome because
of underlying genomic instability are less likely to have biological relevance.  A number
of bioinformatics tools have been developed to identify recurrent copy number alterations
in a single cohort.  However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no currently available
method for identifying recurrent copy number differences between two cohorts.  DiNAMICDuo
was designed to address this shortcoming.
